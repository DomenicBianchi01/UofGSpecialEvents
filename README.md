# UofGSpecialEvents

This app was a Proof Of Concept I had created for the two open houses the University of Guelph hosts per year.

The university prints out thousands of paper pamphlets for each open house to inform prospective students what is happening during the open house. The idea behind this app was to eliminate (or reduce the dependency of) the pamphlets.

Unfortunately the maintainability of the app was a concern for the University ("who would maintain the app after you graduate") and therefore this app never saw the light of day. Oh well.

### Swift UI

There are two branches to this project:
- `master` contains code written using `UIKit`.
- `swiftUI` contains code written using `SwiftUI` (Since this app is a pretty simple app I figured this would be a good candidate to learn Swift UI with; still a Work In Progress)
